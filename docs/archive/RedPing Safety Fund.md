REDPING SAFETY FUND – COMPLETE
 COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT (WITH SAFETY
 JOURNEY SYSTEM)
 1. INTRODUCTION
 The RedPing Safety Fund and Safety Journey System form a unified, legally safe, ethical, and
 scalable framework that ensures every user receives emergency assistance while maintaining fund
 sustainability, preventing abuse, and rewarding long-term safe behavior. This blueprint provides a
 full architectural, operational, financial, and policy-level description.
2. CORE PRINCIPLES
 • Equality of Rescue – All users receive rescue assistance regardless of status.
 • Non-Insurance Model – Assistance depends on fund availability, not guaranteed payouts.
 • Controlled Transparency – Safe dashboards without financial-risk exposure.
 • Sustainability – Monthly contributions, payout caps, AI-based prevention.
 • User Fairness – No discrimination based on badge or stage.
 • Legal Compliance – Avoiding insurance-like pricing or discrimination.
3. SAFETY FUND STRUCTURE
 The Safety Fund contains four sub-pools:
 1. Core Safety Pool – Standard rescue payouts.
 2. Reserve Buffer (20%) – Protection from high rescue months.
 3. Operational Allocation (5%) – Partner management, verification, admin.
 4. Contingency Bucket – Natural disasters and large-scale emergencies.
4. SAFETY FUND CONTRIBUTION MODEL
 • Standard Contribution: $5 per month per user.
 • Orange Stage Contribution: $7.50 (Fund Rebalancing).
 • Red Stage Contribution: $10 (Fund Restoration).
 • Users may opt-out; RedPing still assists in SOS but user pays cost.
 • No risk-based pricing, only community fairness adjustments.
5. RESCUE COST COVERAGE
 Covered:
 • Helicopter rescue
 • Ground SAR
 • Maritime rescue
 • Remote-area extraction
 • 4WD and wilderness recovery
 • Medical emergency transport
 Not Covered:
 • Cash payouts
 • Self-initiated or fake invoices
 • Non-emergency personal transport
6. RESCUE WORKFLOW
 1. SOS triggered (automatic or manual)
 2. RedPing Command Center receives alert
 3. AI severity analysis (motion, speed, GPS, hazard data)
 4. SAR partner contacted
 5. Safety Fund eligibility validated
 6. Rescue dispatched
 7. Invoice verified through SAR partner
 8. Safety Fund pays (or user pays if opted-out)
 9. Dashboard updated with safe transparency information
7. SAFETY JOURNEY SYSTEM – OVERVIEW
 A fully gamified, legal-safe reward system for long-term safety behavior.
 Stages DO NOT influence rescue priority or eligibility.
8. SAFETY JOURNEY STAGES
 Stage 1 — Ambulance Support Badge (6 Months Safe)
 Unlocks after 6 months no claims.
 Rewards: Safety badge, AI safety analysis, enhanced check-ins.
 Stage 2 — Road Assist Badge (1 Year Safe)
 Unlocks after 12 months no claims.
 Rewards: Driving risk report, cloud history, safety perks.
 Stage 3 — 4WD Assist Badge (2 Years Safe)
 Unlocks after 24 months no claims.
 Rewards: Route analysis, survival checklist, hazard alerts.
 Stage 4 — Helicopter Support Badge (3 Years Safe)
 Unlocks after 36 months no claims.
 Rewards: Deep AI risk report, priority support, lifetime fund discount.
 Reset Logic:
 • Any claim resets user to Stage 1 (6-month checkpoint).
 • Streak Freeze protects progress once per year.
9. BADGE & CONTRIBUTION INTEGRATION
 • Green Stage → Standard $5 contribution.
 • Orange Stage → $7.50 (Fund Rebalancing Contribution).
 • Red Stage → $10 (Fund Restoration Contribution).
 These increases are based on community fairness, NOT risk scoring.
10. RESCUE ACCESS GUARANTEE
 • All users can ALWAYS request rescue service.
 • Safety Journey resets NEVER affect access to rescue.
 • If Safety Fund inactive, user pays cost directly.
 • RedPing still handles SOS coordination for all users.
11. ABUSE PREVENTION SYSTEM
 • AI crash/fall signature verification
 • GPS motion and pattern analysis
 • SAR partner confirmation
 • Manual review for repeated claims
 • Fraud detection (sensor mismatch)
 • Funding caps and incident limits
 • Temporary suspension for proven misuse
12. TRANSPARENCY LAYER (SAFE VERSION)
 Users see:
 • Monthly number of rescues
 • Categories of rescue
 • Fund health indicator ( stable, 
• Quarterly utilisation percentage
 • Anonymous success stories
 Users NEVER see:
 • Exact fund balance
 • User-specific payout data
 • Real-time fund transactions
 moderate, 
 high usage)
13. FINANCIAL MODEL SUMMARY (100k Users)
 Monthly Fund Income: $500,000
 Yearly Fund Income: $6,000,000
 Low Rescue Scenario:
 • 100 rescues × $2,000 = $200,000/year
 • Surplus: $5.8 million
 High Rescue Scenario:
 • 1000 rescues × $3,000 = $3,000,000/year
 • Surplus: $3 million
 Financial Stability:
 • Fund remains sustainable under all realistic scenarios.
14. SCALABILITY & GLOBAL DEPLOYMENT
 The Safety Fund and Journey System can scale globally with:
 • Local SAR partners
 • Regional fund buckets
 • International safety coverage
 • AI risk prediction deployment
 • Satellite messaging escalation via partner networks
15. FINAL SUMMARY
 The RedPing Safety Fund + Safety Journey System is:
 • Legally safe
 • Ethically designed

 • Financially sustainable
 • User-trust optimized
 • Globally scalable
 This architecture positions RedPing as the world’s most advanced safety ecosystem.
