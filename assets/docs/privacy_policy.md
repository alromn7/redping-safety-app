**EMERGENCY DATA NOTICE**: During emergency situations, your data is shared immediately with designated emergency contacts via SMS and with SAR teams via Firebase to protect your safety and facilitate rescue operations. SMS alerts include your location, medical information, and Google Maps link. The system uses intelligent escalation, sending alerts every 2 minutes and expanding to secondary contacts after 5 minutes if no response is received. This sharing is essential for the app's core safety mission and occurs automatically during active emergencies. **Note**: The app cannot directly contact emergency services (911/112/999) due to platform restrictions; emergency contacts must manually call emergency services on your behalf.

**By using REDP!NG, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Privacy Policy.**
