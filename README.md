## ⚠️ MANDATORY GOVERNANCE FOR DEVELOPERS

**Before making ANY changes to this codebase, READ:**

1. 🔒 **[BATTERY GOVERNANCE RULES](BATTERY_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md)** - MANDATORY compliance framework
2. 📖 **[Battery Optimization Blueprint](docs/ultra_battery_optimization.md)** - Complete technical specification
3. 📋 **[Quick Reference Card](BATTERY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Developer checklist (print & keep)

**Key Rules**:
- ✅ Battery impact assessment required before ANY sensor/battery code changes
- ✅ 24-hour battery test must pass (≤32% daily consumption)
- ✅ All 5 smart enhancements must remain functional
- ✅ Always-on reliability must stay ≥95%
- ✅ Documentation must be updated with every change
- ✅ 2 code reviewers required (1 battery-certified)

**Non-compliance = PR blocked + potential rollback**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**:
- Flutter SDK ^3.9.2
- Android Studio / Xcode
- Physical device for testing (battery tests require real hardware)

### **Installation**:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd redping_14v

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on device (NOT emulator for battery testing)
flutter run
```

### **First-Time Setup**:
1. Read `BATTERY_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md` (REQUIRED)
2. Complete Level 1 battery certification quiz
3. Review `docs/ultra_battery_optimization.md`
4. Print and keep `BATTERY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` at desk
5. Set up local 24-hour battery test environment

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Battery Tests** (REQUIRED before PR):
```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test test/services/sensor_service_test.dart
flutter test test/services/platform_service_test.dart

# 24-hour on-device test (MANDATORY)
# 1. Fully charge device to 100%
# 2. Start app with monitoring enabled
# 3. Use device normally for 24 hours
# 4. Check battery consumption ≤32%
# 5. Verify always-on reliability ≥95%
# 6. Document results in PR
```

### **Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Daily battery consumption ≤32%
- ✅ 24-hour runtime ≥25 hours (extrapolated)
- ✅ Always-on reliability ≥95%
- ✅ SOS response time ≤1 second
- ✅ Sleep mode consumption ≤0.5%/hour
- ✅ Automatic restart after reboot

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **Making Changes**:
1. **STOP** - Read `BATTERY_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md` Rule 1
2. Complete battery impact assessment checklist
3. If ANY item = YES → Redesign or get exception approval
4. Implement with battery optimization in mind
5. Run required battery tests (8 tests)
6. Update documentation (blueprint + summary + code comments)
7. Complete PR checklist (10 items)
8. Get 2 reviewer approvals (1 battery-certified)
9. Pass CI/CD regression tests
10. Tag stable version if merged

### **Files to Update** (for battery-related changes):
- `docs/ultra_battery_optimization.md` - Blueprint
- `COMPLETE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Metrics
- Code comments - Battery impact notes
- Test files - Regression tests

---

## 📊 Weekly Compliance Monitoring

**Every Monday, review**:
- Average daily battery consumption (target ≤32%)
- Always-on reliability percentage (target ≥95%)
- SOS response time p95 (target ≤1s)
- User-reported battery issues (target 0)
- Code review compliance rate (target 100%)

**Alert Thresholds**:
- ⚠️ Daily consumption >35% → Investigate
- 🚨 Daily consumption >40% → Emergency rollback
- ⚠️ Always-on reliability <90% → Check exemption
- 🚨 SOS response >2s → Critical bug

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

**If battery regression detected**:
```bash
# 1. Stop all deployments
# 2. Identify last stable version
git tag --list 'battery-v*'

# 3. Rollback
git checkout battery-v1.2  # Last stable tag
git checkout -b hotfix/battery-regression

# 4. Fix and re-test
# ... fix code ...
# Run 24-hour battery test

# 5. Merge when ≤32% daily confirmed
```
