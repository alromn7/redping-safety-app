# RedPing Safety Fund - Safe Model Alignment Review
## Updated December 2, 2025

---

## ✅ SIMPLIFIED PRICING - NO CONSUMER ADD-ONS

### What Changed:
**REMOVED:**
- ❌ Satellite SOS device (+$3/month)
- ❌ Premium analytics (+$2/month)
- ❌ Family plan (+$8/month)
- ❌ Priority coordination (+$5/month)

### Why Removed:
1. **User confusion** - Multiple price points confuse the value proposition
2. **Looks like coverage tiers** - Creates insurance appearance
3. **Legal risk** - Tiered pricing = tiered coverage in regulator's eyes
4. **Complexity** - Harder to communicate, harder to sell
5. **Support burden** - More SKUs = more support questions

### What We Keep:
✅ **$5/month base** - Simple, clear, no confusion  
✅ **$15/month repayment** - Automatic after using fund  
✅ **B2B enterprise plans** - Separate product line

## 💼 B2B REVENUE FOCUS

### Why B2B > Consumer Add-ons:

**Higher Revenue:**
- 5 companies @ $5K/month = $25K/month
- vs. 2,000 consumers @ $4/month avg = $8K/month
- **3x revenue with 400x fewer customers!**

**Lower Churn:**
- Corporate contracts: 12-36 month terms
- Consumer add-ons: Cancel anytime, high churn

**Predictable Income:**
- Annual contracts paid upfront
- Easier forecasting
- Better cash flow

**Legal Separation:**
- B2B = coordination service (clear)
- Consumer add-ons = coverage enhancements (risky)

**Simpler Support:**
- 5 dedicated account managers
- vs. 2,000 individual support tickets

## 🎓 USER EDUCATION STRATEGY

### Key Messages:

**What RedPing IS:**
> "RedPing is a safety communication platform with community pooling - NOT insurance. We coordinate rescue and provide community assistance when you have no other options."

**External Coverage Priority:**
> "Have WorkCover, private health, or roadside assist? Always use YOURS first! Safety Fund is backup for when you have nothing else. Using your own coverage = journey continues at $5/month. Skipping it = penalty split + repayment."

**Repayment System:**
> "Using Safety Fund triggers repayment: $5→$15/month until you've repaid what the community covered for you. This keeps the fund sustainable for everyone. You can pay lump sum anytime."

**Journey Stages:**
> "Journey stages recognize your time in the community and safety habits. They're NOT coverage levels - that would make us insurance. Stages determine community assistance splits when fund is used."

**Pricing Simplicity:**
> "One price: $5/month. That's it. No tiers, no add-ons, no confusion. B2B enterprise plans available separately for companies."
